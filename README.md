===============

Takes an image like this:

![original](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gferrin/image-scrambler/master/wortzel.jpg)

And then makes it look like this:

![final](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gferrin/image-scrambler/master/final/one.jpg)

which is not as easy to do as you might imagine.
